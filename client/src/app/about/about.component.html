          All of our products are hand-crafted overseas by minors in poor conditions, with the customer in mind.
          We strive to make the cheapest possible product, with the highest possible markup. All of our designs
          were completed in roughly 30 seconds by our top fashion designers. If you have any questions,
          we don't have a customer support team, so keep them to yourself.
